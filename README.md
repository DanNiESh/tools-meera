# OPE Tool

This tool is designed to facilitate the management of projects within the Open Publishing Environment (OPE). It includes a variety of functions for handling repositories, books, containers, and course creation.

## Installation
Before you install the ope tool and create your own open source textbook with the tool, make sure you have the dependencies you need by running:

```pip install jupyter-book```

```pip install ghp-import```

Installation instructions:
1. On your device, create a directory
- To do this run the command: ```mkdir <example-name>``` where example name is what you want to name your directory
2. When youâ€™re in the directory run the command: ```git clone git@github.com:OPEFFORT/tools.git```
3. Then cd into the tools directory tools
- You can run the command: ```cd tools```
4. Run the command: ```./install.sh```
- Post-installation instructions should print
- Run the first command in the post installation instructions: it should look something like this: ```export PATH=/home/your-laptop-name/txt/tools/bin:$PATH```

Your environment should be set up, and you can use the ope tool to create your project. To test if the ope is installled, run ```ope```, if it is insalled, a list of ope commands should print on your terminal

How to create a new project:
1. Outside of the terminal, make a new github repository
2. Copy the ssh link that you usually would make usually use for git clone to clipboard, it should look like this: ```git@github.com:github-username/repo.git```
- Make sure you use the ssh link, and not the http
3. Then use the ope new_project command with the link you copied, it should look like: ```ope new_project <your-project-name> [git@github.com:github-username/repo.git]```
- The repo is an optional argument, if you would like to add it later on, use the ```ope repo_add``` command later
4. Move out of tools and back into the root directory, if you are not already in the root directory
5. If you exit the terminal, and refresh your github repository, the repository should be populated with tools for your first ope book

You have now created your first project, and can create a new textbook

How to create a new book:
1. Enter back into the terminal, and cd into the books folder
2. Once you are in the books folder, use the ope new_book command to create a new textbook, run:
- ```ope new_book <your-book-name>```
3. Once you are in books, you can work on editing the content
4. cd into your new book, and cd into the content folder

Editing your new book:
1. While you are in the content folder, open up a text editor, and go to the your-text-book-name_config.yml file
2. Edit the title to be your book name as well as the name and copyright year
3. Under repository, change the url to be relevant to your textbook as well, keeping github at the beginning
- It should look like: https://github.com/yourname/relevant-textbook-phrase
4. Then open up the your-text-book-name_intro.md file
5. This file will be your books introduction, edit it to populate your landing page
6. Open up your-text-book-name_toc.yml this file will contain your intended structure for your textbook
7. To add chapters or sections to this book, add the text under this line, under parts, where each file or section is the path to the chapter content
```
- caption: 'Chapter 1'
  numbered: true
  chapters:
  - file: introduction/intro/chapter1
  - file: introduction/intro/chapter2
  sections:
  - file: introduction/intro/section1
```
You can change numbered to false, if you don't want your chapters to be numbered

8. To have content where that chapter will be, create a folder in the content folder, following the path you wrote in the previous step
  - For example, if I placed a chapter in introduction/intro/chapter1, in content I would create a directory introduction, and within that directory create another directory, intro. Within intro I would make a file called chapter1.ipynb
  - Remember to add the .ipynb, even though the path you wrote in the tock.yml file does not include it
  - If you need a sample .ipynb file, you can look at or even copy the what's in the dummy file as a template
9. Continue this process until your textbook structure is layed out and your folders are populated with the corresponding .ipynb's
10. To see what your textbook looks like, go into the books folder and run ```ope build``` and copy and paste the provided link in your browser
  - If you are having issue using the command, ensure that you are in a folder with the Makefile


Publishing your textbook:

11. While in the books folder with the Makefile, which should share the title of your book, run ```ope pub```
12. You can now check github, where a second branch called gh-pages, for github pages, should be published
13. Check the actions tab, and wait until your textbook is deployed
14. Go to settings, and then github pages, then click on the link where it says your site is live
15. Once you are on the site, it will give you a 404 error, do not worry, that's normal, just add your book's name at the end of the url, and your textbook will be hosted
16. Your book should be published and accessible by anyone!


Common issues:
- If you're getting issues with Make, make sure you are running ope build and ope pub in the folder with the Makefile
- If you're unable to use ope tools, cd back into tools, and reset your path by following the instructions and copy and pasting the export PATH line
- If nothing is appearing on your site, make sure your .ipynbs have titles
