The Tools branch of OPE contains the main ope tool along with its friends.

Here is some of my current thinking

# OPE commands

## Project Commands

### `ope project <name>`

### `ope book new <name>`

### `ope container new <name>`

## Book Commands

### `ope build`

### `ope publish`

### `ope print`

### `ope test`

## Container 

### `ope run [user|root]`

### `ope build`

### `ope publish`


# USER GUIDE Draft

## OPE USER GUIDE

A collection of OPE books and associated container images are organized into a project.

## Creating a new OPE project

We will use the project `ucsls` as a running example.

1. We recommend that you create a new email address that will act as the central admin address for your project.  Eg. ucsls.organization@gmail.com.  You can then use this as the admin and identity for all online resources of your project.

2. Assuming that you are using github or gitlab we recommend you create a new organization for your project.  If you will be publishing containers as part of your project we also recommend that you create an docker image registery organization.
